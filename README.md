# CS245_Principle_Data_Science
This is the online code repo for the class CS245 taught in SJTU by Prof. Li Niu. 

Lab 1 and lab 2 are done by Xiang Gu and Tao Zhu;
Lab 3 is done by Weihong Lin;
Lab 4 is done by Chacha Chen.

Since the labs are finished by different students, the usage of code is different.
For lab 1 and lab2, simply download the AwA2-features file from https://cvml.ist.ac.at/AwA2/ and put it into the lab 1 or lab 2 directory. Then you will be able to run those jupyter notebooks for each lab.

For lab 3, you need to download the real pictures (13G) from the same website and change the `dataset_path` in *generate_data_list* to your own local path of your cloned lab 3 folder. Then you will be able to run these .py files.


For lab 4, download the office-home dataset at http://hemanthdv.org/OfficeHome-Dataset/. Run code in corresponding folders.
